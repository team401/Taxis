Taxis (pronounced tack-sis) is Team 401's control library.  It contains general purpose classes to control various mechanisms, namely differential drivetrains.

Taxis is designed to work with [SnakeSkin](https://github.com/team401/SnakeSkin), and depends on many of its classes.  Please make sure you are using [SnakeSkin](https://github.com/team401/SnakeSkin) in your project before trying to use this library.

## Credits

Most of the code for differential drive control was pulled from [FRC Team 254's 2018 robot code](https://github.com/team254/FRC-2018-Public).  Although the package structure has been changed to unify all code into a single package, some of these files are untouched from 254's code.  Any of these files are clearly marked in the header with a path to the original file.
